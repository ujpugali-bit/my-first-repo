# Life as a PM

Being a product manager is a mix of tiny victories and impossible-to-ignore trade-offs. Some days are full of user interviews and sticky notes; other days are spent arguing about one line of copy that somehow decides whether a flow converts.

Key scenes from a typical week:

- Morning: scan metrics, rescue a dashboard that stopped reporting, and sip too-cold coffee.
- Midday: three meetings — a design critique, a roadmap sync, and a sprint planning that turns philosophical.
- Afternoon: write a short brief, unblock engineering, and clarify acceptance criteria until it feels obvious.
- Evening: read feedback threads and jot down ideas for an experiment.

What keeps it interesting:

- The people: shipping feels different when you watch someone light up using something you helped shape.
- The puzzles: product problems are messy and require both empathy and stubbornness.
- The experiments: small bets, big learnings — and the satisfying math when a hypothesis proves true.

Advice I’d give my past self:

1. Ask more "why" early, then again.
2. Protect focus time — it’s when the best decisions are made.
3. Ship small, learn fast, and don't mistake activity for impact.

A closing thought

Product management is less about heroic vision and more about patient leadership: nudging a team toward a better answer and celebrating the tiny, iterative wins along the way.
